                            Gabia is the biggest Internet business solution company in Korea, which provides all the groundworks for the infrastructure like domains and hostings. I was given redesigning the website of Gabia for proposal. The website hadn’t been changed since 200X and it obviously looked outdated. They were actively searching for new ideas. So, I came up with my idea of the best website for Gabia.

Our next goal was to upgrade the app for heavy users who use every day and purchase a large volume of our pay comics.

                        and the basic goal was to : 
                        Provide users with app that allows them to fully focus on reading and only reading which we believe is the core value of the service.

                        Through competitor analysis, I gained an insight that the simpler the process was the easier it felt and looked for customers to make the payment. Simple and easy dialog popups for payment in one service was a good example that showed this insight. This also led me to think that we could skip the redundant step through skipping a confirmation pop-up, or combine the two separate invoices and cash recharge pages into one so that you can check how much cash you have left and make the purchase from the same page.

                        One day during a meeting, we were having a discussion about things that could be improved, and one thing we covered was some problems with the payment process on the app. This made me feel interested to tackle this in order to upgrade our service and it could have been a great chance for me to study more about the UX regarding the payment portion. So I studied and learned a lot coming up with the proposal with the solution that I shared with our team which then received positive feedback. We decided to kill the project, but it was a nice chance for our team and myself to learn more about the UX in the payment.
