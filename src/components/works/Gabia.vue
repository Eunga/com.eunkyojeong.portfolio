              Gabia is the biggest Internet business solution company in Korea, which provides all the groundwork for the infrastructure like domains and hostings. I was given a task to redesign the website of Gabia for the proposal. The website hadn’t been changed since 2010 and over time it became obsolete. Thus they were eagerly searching for new ideas. So, I proposed a design that would best fit Gabia.

            The existing customers had a tendency to take a shortcut straight to My page whereas potential customers don’t. So I came up with this plan that this main homepage should help new potential customers to easily understand what the deal is since it wasn’t happening with the old design. For that’s the most essential part for the company to gain new clients, I focused on attracting potential new customers on our web page.
