                            ‘Offin’ is an app on a platform for an online open market available only for offline stores. It’s like an ‘online showroom’ but you can also make payments for the purchase. I joined the team as the one and only designer. I could work with the developers very closely as we built iOS and Android apps and a website. We were very thrilled and inspired to create a new shopping experience.

                            There are so many offline clothing stores in Korea that have no brand names. We called them ‘Bo-se’ in Korean. For these stores, we wondered how people could find them and their products without actually having to have to visit the store.

                        <div>
                            According to the research, a quarter of Koreans was shopping at non-branded clothing stores compared to branded stores. But, the problem is mostly all of the non-branded stores don’t have online stores unless they are major retails like Stylenanda or Imvely, while the branded stores have their own online websites. So, there was no way for customers to find and purchase the clothes that they have seen from offline stores online, and for store owners to offer their products to potential customers other than in the form of offline stores.

                            ‘Offin’ sounds similar to ‘Oatpin’ which means ‘clothing pins’ in Korea. So, it became a motif for brand design. This logo enabled people to recognize at a glance that it’s got something to do with the fashion business. As well, since we provide a location-based service on the map to find the closest stores from your location, we put the pin on a map icon.

                                At first, we provided a hamburger menu, but we thought there could be a better way so what we did here is to change the hamburger menu to a tab bar at the bottom mainly for 2 reasons listed down below.

                                The service we provided was obviously new to the users so we wanted users to better understand what we are offering just at a glance. We realized that from the homepage the hamburger menu could hardly show users what other services and pages they can turn to unless they click and find the menu since it was hidden. Showing Stylefeed on the main page was one of the major features but at the same time, it was also important that we availed other tabs to allow users to explore around other stores.

                                With the former hamburger menu, it involved more clicks from users to find the pages and contents you were looking for whereas with the tab bar, you could find the contents simply with a single click. Furthermore, with the hamburger menu, it would only show on the main page which then would disappear once you click into the next page. Once you are on that page, you can’t find the hamburger menu unless you go back to the main page which then you will have to start again from the top, but with the tab bar, you can go back, but you can find where you need to be right away since the tab bars are fixed to be at the bottom.

                                The app provides users with an exact location to nearby stores. Users can search and find stores in remote areas that can be difficult to find online. Users can find clothes they pinned at the offline store and try them on before they make the purchase or vice versa. It’s a win-win for both customers and store owners since customers can look around the items freely before they pick items they like, and once they visit the store, it’s beneficial for store owners as well since they can visit and pick up more clothes so they could expect potential sales profit.
