              In Hanssem, the biggest furniture company in Korea, I was one of the earlier members of the Howser team. The 3D home planner of Howser provides users to re-design and decorate their home with their furniture, flooring, and wall colors with branded goods. Using the 3D home planner, users can decorate their homes with home plans and interior decorations in 3D bringing interior ideas to life.

This means that they needed to measure the size and length of all rooms and every piece of furniture they were planning to buy to see if they fit, so it was much work for customers to pick furniture pieces. So we started this project with the following question that came into light. “Can we offer a service that could help people to visually see the simulation of the layout before they actually make the purchase of them? It can enhance the shopping experience for our customers and it could have a positive impact on our sales!”</div>
